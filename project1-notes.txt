QUESTIONS

> Should desktop images be Med size files? They exceed the XXXX kb limit. Should I optimize them?

> h1 header in mobile gets pushed down when hamburger gets pushed down. It's because of the h1 margins in desktop. Is there a better way?

> Should I make the svg hamburger menu inline or as an image?

> How should the header HTML structure be? h1 first, then the navs? Navs first, then the h1?

> Should we be compressing the large photo files? For Desktop, I'm using Med size (without compression)

> Use single side border targeting for address in Contact Us?

> Any other method to use besides margin: -X to remove padding above?

> Are we supposed to reference height values in Zeplin design?

> Not sure how to fix Contact section

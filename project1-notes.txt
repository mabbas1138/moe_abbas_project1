> Add #maincontent to sections (for skip link)

> Make sure you're not floating <a> (float the <li>)

> Make sure you're styling the links <a>, not the <li>

> style a tags in servicesLinks, not the li (see simple-nav exercise)


> **It doesn't matter if list-style: none is on ul or li. But be consistent.



> Consider taking out .companyName class and just leave as h1

> Use imported numbers for font weight 

> Leave comments in HTML to justify choices

> Include Apple Touch icons and Favicon for the desktop site. Make sure to add more than one Apple Touch links (see notes)

QUESTIONS

> I DIDN'T USE 1600px MAX WIDTH -- HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR IT?

*Recommended usage for margin and padding:

    To style spacing within and around the element, not for page layout or positioning large structural blocks.

    -- Should the following NOT use margin and padding?  
    1) 

> Should desktop images be Med size files? They exceed the XXXX kb limit. Should I optimize them?

> h1 header in mobile gets pushed down when hamburger gets pushed down. It's because of the h1 margins in desktop. Is there a better way?

> Should I make the svg hamburger menu inline or as an image?

> How should the header HTML structure be? h1 first, then the navs? Navs first, then the h1?

> Should we be compressing the large photo files? For Desktop, I'm using Med size (without compression)

> Use single side border targeting for address in Contact Us?

> Any other method to use besides margin: -X to remove padding above?

> Are we supposed to reference height values in Zeplin design?

> Not sure how to fix Contact section
